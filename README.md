### Installation

This repository requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to run.

#### `yarn install`

### Development

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

### iOS

#### `yarn ios`

Like yarn start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### Android

#### `yarn android`

Like yarn start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
